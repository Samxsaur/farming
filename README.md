# farming
Its my first game using unity 2d, I'm going to make a small farming game in isometric and using a console to input commands

So basically I want to create a simple farming game using a console to input commands, I have taken inspiration from Wintermute Digital, https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuajyE6kZ9yU-qypGoJmXeQ

I took inspiration from his game called Maelstrom.exe, for a game jam he did, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qh7MCQzjH08&t=684s

I want to create a simple game like his however make changes and edits, essentially converting it to my own project, it will have differences so hopefully should not be copyright or whatever 

I'm still quite new and lack an understanding, but the program should go as follows

Player enters a command into the console, its submitted. Split up according to spaces, and the first word is a function. Second and third/ fourth or whatnot are positions or parameters
for instance, Water A1 B3 C2, The water is calling on my function, the positions of the tiles are, A1, B3 and C2, so it should water those tiles specifically, updating their appearence.
